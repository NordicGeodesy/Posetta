Posetta is being developed as an open NKG project at GitHub (see Figure~\ref{fig:github}). At \url{github.com/nordicgeodesy/posetta} anybody (not only NKG members) can download the software, report bugs and issues, or contribute code to the project.

To try the software for yourself, simply go to Posetta's GitHub web page and follow the instructions. As Posetta is still in prototype status, you need to install Python manually before installing Posetta. We plan to simplify the installation process as Posetta matures.
